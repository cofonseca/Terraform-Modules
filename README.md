# Terraform-Modules
This repository contains all Terraform modules used to build my organization's cloud infrastrucure in Microsoft Azure. A module can be thought of as a template of what a particular resource should look like when it gets created.

The modules in this repository are generic enough that they can be used by others to create similar groups of resources. This repository is incomplete, so you'll also need the code in my "Terraform" repository, which includes variable files that can be modified to your liking.
